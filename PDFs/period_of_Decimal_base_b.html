<strong><i>                 Results from number theory.</i></strong> We need some background material
    from number theory to establish periods of the new class of generators.This
    elementary material has been known for hundreds of years,but it is seldom
    mentioned in modern books.We summarize it here.It concerns the decimal
    expansions of fractions--expansions to a base b,rather than the customary
    base 10 -- but we illustrate with the more familiar base 10.
    </pre>
    <p>Let the modulus m be chosen and consider the group `G` of `phi( m )`reduced<br>
    residues of m relatively prime to m.For k in G we want the base-b expansion<br>
    of k/m.That expansion is strictly periodic with period the order of b in the<br>
    group G.(This requires the assumption that `b in G`.) The cyclic subgroup<br>
    generated by b partitions `G` into cosets. Two elements g and h of G are <br>
        equivalent (belong to the same coset) if `g = hb^j` for some j.If two elements<br>
        g,h belong to the same coset,then g/m and h/m have the same base-b<br>
        expansion with period the order of b,except that the "digits" in their periods<br>
        are cyclic permutations of one another.</p><br>

<p>EXAMPLE.Modulus m = 39,base b = 10.The powers of 10 mod m gener<br>
    -ate the cyclic subgroup {1,10,22,25,16,4},so the order of 10 for modulus 39<br>
    is 6.Successive elements h of that subgroup have a common set of digits in the<br>
    period-6 decimal expansion of h /m,each a cyclic permutation of the previous<br>
    one:</p><br>
`1/39 = 0.025641025.., 10/39 = 0.256410256...., 22/39 = 0.564102564....`<br><br>
`25/39 = 0.641025641..., 16/39= 0.410256410...., 4/39= 0.102564102....`<br>
<p>Now choose an element not in the first coset,  say 2.Its coset is<br>
    {2,20,5,11,32,8),and ratios h/m with h from that coset all have the same<br>
    digits in their period-6 decimal expansions,shifted by one because of succes<br>
    -sive multiplications by the base 10:</p><br>
`2/39= 0.051282051...,20/39= 0.512820512..,5/39= 0.128205128....`<br><br>
`11/39= 0.282051282....,16/39= 0.820512820....,8/39= 0 .205128205....`<br>
<p>For our purposes,we want to choose primes m for which b is a primitive<br>
    root.Then the period is m- 1for the base-b expansion of every proper<br>
    fraction h/m.</p><br>
