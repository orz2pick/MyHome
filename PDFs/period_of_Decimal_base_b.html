<strong><i>                     Results from number theory.</i></strong> We need some background material
        from number theory to establish periods of the new class of generators.This
        elementary material has been known for hundreds of years,but it is seldom
        mentioned in modern books.We summarize it here.It concerns the decimal
        expansions of fractions--expansions to a base b,rather than the customary
        base 10 -- but we illustrate with the more familiar base 10.

            Let the modulus m be chosen and consider the group `G` of `phi( m )`reduced
        residues of m relatively prime to m.For k in G we want the base-b expansion
        of k/m.That expansion is strictly periodic with period the order of b in the
        group G.(This requires the assumption that `b in G`.) The cyclic subgroup
        generated by b partitions `G` into cosets. Two elements g and h of G are
        equivalent (belong to the same coset) if `g = hb^j` for some j.If two elements
        g,h belong to the same coset,then g/m and h/m have the same base-b
        expansion with period the order of b,except that the "digits" in their periods
        are cyclic permutations of one another.</pre>

            EXAMPLE.Modulus m = 39,base b = 10.The powers of 10 mod m gener
        -ate the cyclic subgroup {1,10,22,25,16,4},so the order of 10 for modulus 39
        is 6.Successive elements h of that subgroup have a common set of digits in the
        period-6 decimal expansion of h /m,each a cyclic permutation of the previous
        one:

        1/39  = 0.025641025..,  10/39 = 0.256410256...., 22/39 = 0.564102564....<br>
        25/39 = 0.641025641..., 16/39 = 0.410256410...., 4/39  = 0.102564102....

            Now choose an element not in the first coset, say 2.Its coset is
        {2,20,5,11,32,8),and ratios h/m with h from that coset all have the same
        digits in their period-6 decimal expansions,shifted by one because of succes
        -sive multiplications by the base 10:

        2/39  = 0.051282051...,   20/39 = 0.512820512..,  5/39 = 0.128205128....<br>
        11/39 = 0.282051282...., 16/39 = 0.820512820...., 8/39 = 0.205128205....

            For our purposes,we want to choose primes m for which b is a primitive
        root.Then the period is m - 1 for the base-b expansion of every proper fraction h/m.
